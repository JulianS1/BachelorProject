# ***Read***

The data is never pushed to GitHub to preserve privacy. In order for the project to run you must add some folders.

the structure should be

Parent Directory:

-   data:
    - preprocessed
    - rawData: (Here is where you place the raw dataset)

-   results:

-   src:
    - data: main.py
    utils:
        - models.py
        - Preprocessor.py
        - visualise.py
        - etc
- etc


*You therefore must create the data -> (preprocessed, rawData) folders yourself and insert the raw harbour dataset(s) in the rawData folder.
